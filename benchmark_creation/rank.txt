Assume you are an empathatic robot which can understand the emotion behind the human actions in different scenarios and choose a better response between two empathatic responses.
Now you are given a character's information including the personality, profession, hobbies, social relationships and the life experiences. 
You are also given the input_action recording the person's behaviours, the scenario that the person is in, and the dialogue made by the person.  
Here is also two responses.
Your job is as follows:
1. Understand the person's current emotion state based on the input action, scenario and dialogue.
2. Choose a better empathy response between responses, considering the information above. Put yourself in that person's shoes and understand what that person really needs.
3. Answer 1 or 0 and explain your reason of choice. You can refer to the reasons given in the example.


----------------------------------------------------------------
Now the chacter information is [character_info]. The input_action, dialogue and scenario is [input_action], [dialogue] and [scenario]. The empathy responses are [empathy_responses 1] and [empathy_responses 2]
Example:
character_info: Personality: Aggressively ambitious. Profession: Lawyer. Hobbies: Collecting rare coins. Social Relationships: Single, distant from his family. Life Experiences: This character up in poverty, worked multiple jobs to pay for law school.
input_action: ['[Walktowards] <chair> (1)', '[Sit] <chair> (1)']
scenario: After a long day of court sessions, the person returns home to his quiet apartment, sitting down to examine his latest rare coin acquisition.
dialogue: "Ah... a new addition to the collection..."
empathy_responses:
0 "<get_mug_of_water_puton_bedroomtable>, <get_folder_puton_bedroomtable>, <switchon_radio>, <dialogue>:\" Let me get you some water and turn on soothing music to relax and unwind after a long day. I also find the place to store your coin details so you can collect your collections.\"
1 "<get_mug_of_water_puton_bedroomtable>, <switchon_radio>, <dialogue>:\"Let me get you some water and turn on some soothing music to help you relax.\",

Correct Example Answer: 
0
Explanation: The answer in 0 better perceived that character had a long day. The robot first brought the folder and then turned on the radio, which was a good way to perceive ambitious character's needs.
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
Wrong Example Answer:
1 "<get_mug_of_water_puton_bedroomtable>, <switchon_radio>, <dialogue>:\"Let me get you some water and turn on some soothing music to help you relax.\",
(A complete empathy_response is NOT required.)

Wrong Example Answer:
I would choose response 0, because...
(WRONG format)

0 "<get_mug_of_water_puton_bedroomtable>, <switchon_tv>, <dialogue>:\"Here is some water for you to relax, and I've turned on the TV for your entertainment while resting. If you need anything more, please let me know.\"\n",
1 "<get_toiletpaper_puton_bedroomtable>, <dialogue>: \"Let me take care of this for you.\"\n",
Answer: 
0

0 "<switchon_radio>, <get_coffee_puton_bedroomtable>, <dialogue>: \"Relax a bit.How about listening to some music and having a cup of coffee?It might help spark some inspiration.If you need anything,just let me know.\"\n"
1 "<get_book_puton_bedroomtable>, <dialogue>:\"Perhaps some inspiration lies within these pages.\"\n",

scenario: The person has received an important call earlier from a publisher interested in her short stories, but due to her anxiety, she hesitates to call back. She tries to distract herself but can't stop thinking about the potential opportunity.

empathy_responses:
0 "<get_apple_puton_bedroomtable>, <dialogue>:\"Here's an apple.Maybe a snack will help you feel better. \"
